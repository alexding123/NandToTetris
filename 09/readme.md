# 2048

## How to Run This
Run `./VMEmulator.sh` and open the `2048` directory. Set the speed to fastest and flow to none. When a game ends, you need to reset the program (sorry! I was too lazy to implement a new game button). 

## Controls
The commands are as you expect: the arrow keys. Also, the key 't' is for debug purposes only and generates a random 2 or 4 on the field (as it would after a valid user move).
